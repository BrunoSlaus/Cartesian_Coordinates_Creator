# Cartesian_Coordinates_Creator
A code which creates 3D Cartesian coordinates from RA, DEC, z. The code also produces a 3D plot of the survey.
The code allows the final catalogue to have one aditional column. Here it was named "RPA" but this can be changed.

The code to run is called "Main.py". The other codes are called from this main one.

The code requires the user to create folders called "Input", "Output", "Output_Plot" and "log" in the same folder 
where the code is located.
